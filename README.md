### Overview üéÅ
API Management Authorizations greatly simplifies the process of authenticating and authorizing user's across one (or) more SaaS services üëç. It reduces the development cost in ramping up, implementing and maintaining security features with service integrations üí∞.

Configure OAuth, Consent, Acquire Tokens, Cache Tokens and Refresh Tokens for multiple-services without writing a single line of code. Let API Management do all the heavy lifting for you, while you focus on the application/domain logic.

To get more information, please visit the official Azure documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/api-management/authorizations-overview).   

### Scenarios üß∞

Here are some example scenarios where this feature could be used:
- Easily connect to SaaS backend by attaching the stored Authorization Token and proxying requests. 
- Proxy requests to a Azure AppService WebApp (or) Azure Functions backend by attaching the Authorization Token that can later send requests to SaaS backend applying transformation logic. 
- Proxy requests to GraphQL federation backends by attaching multiple access tokens to easy perform federation.
- Expose a retrieve token endpoint, acquire cached token and call the SaaS on-behalf of user from any compute, say Console App or Kubernetes Demon. Combine your fav. SaaS Sdk in a supported language.
- Azure Functions unattended scenarios is a breeze while connecting to multiple SaaS.
- Durable Functions gets a step closer to Logic Apps with SaaS connectivity.
- Every API in API Management can act as a Logic Apps Custom Connector.
